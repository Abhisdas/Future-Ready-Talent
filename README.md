### Project Title :
Medpill - Provide affordable healthcare services

### Problem Statement/Opportunity :
Access to health information: Online health websites provide easy access to health information for people who might not have access to this information otherwise. This can include people who live in remote areas or those who have limited access to healthcare resources.

Convenience: Online health websites provide a convenient way for people to access health information and resources from the comfort of their own homes. This can save time and money compared to traditional healthcare services.

Empowerment: Online health websites can empower people to take control of their own health and make informed decisions about their healthcare. This can lead to better health outcomes and a higher quality of life.

### Project Description :
The Medpill website is expertly made and perfectly suited for medical applications including hospital supplies, clinics, surgical websites, clinical laboratories, and healthcare facilities, among others.
This website makes it simple for you to keep track of all of your medical requirements, including doctor recommendations for treatment.
The Medpill website is a platform that offers numerous medical services online. These services may include access to medical information and resources, online prescription ordering, consultations with medical specialists, and ordering of medical supplies. For people who are unable to physically attend a healthcare centre owing to physical, logistical, or other limitations as well as for those who would prefer the ease of getting healthcare services from the comfort of their homes, online healthcare websites can be helpful. The workload of healthcare professionals may also be lessened and patient wait times can be kept to a minimum with the use of online healthcare portals. It's crucial to remember that, despite their convenience, internet healthcare websites should never take the place of urgently needed in-person medical care.
